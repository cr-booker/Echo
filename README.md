A clone of the classic board game Simon, Echo, is a sequence matching memory game thats sure to kill 
some boredom when you just need some simple mindless entertainment.


## Ok cool, How do get this running?

Download the files, extract to your preferred directory, and open the index.html with your favorite browser.

## Gotcha, How do i play? what are the rules? 

![Demo](screenshots/Echo-demo.gif)
Good question. 
Echo is a simple game.
The player simply watches the sequence the game generates and attempts to repeat (echo) the sequence correctly.
Get it right, you move on to the next round.

Get it wrong and your family will abandon you, your friends will gossip behind you back and your enemies will 
take immense pleasure in your defeat. 
Also, you'll have to start over, lame.

You dont beat Echo, much like life, you just try and do a little better.

## Can you give me cheats codes for the game?

Yes, but it'll turn off in-game achievements.
